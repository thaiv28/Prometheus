    """Compute GLORY (or GLORB baseline) team rankings.

    Fits the GLORY regression model separately for each requested year (always
    using all major leagues for modeling), scores team season averages, then
    optionally filters to the leagues provided and concatenates yearly results.

    Parameters
    ----------
    features : list[str] | None, optional
        Feature columns to use. Defaults to `GLORY_FEATURES` when None.
    year : int | iterable[int] | None, optional
        Single year, multiple years, or None for all supported years.
    league : str | iterable[str] | None, optional
        League code(s) to include in final output; modeling always uses all major leagues.
    rescale : bool, default True
        If True, rescales raw model scores (or baseline sum) to 0â€“100.
    baseline : bool, default False
        If True, compute GLORB baseline (equal weights) instead of GLORY regression output.
    z_scores : bool, default True
        If True, adds `era_score` (overall z) and `league_score` (within-league z).
    cols_to_return : list[str] | None, optional
        Additional columns (besides teamname/score/year/league) to keep in output.
    minimum_matches : int, default 0
        Minimum number of matches required for a team-season to be included.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        Combined ranking across requested years, sorted by score descending. Columns include
        at least teamname, score, year, league, and optionally era_score / league_score when z_scores is True.
